            VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) is, for many applications, the holy grail of UAV design. It allows 
            long range, high endurance aircraft to take off and land in small areas as a rotorcraft do. However, 
            VTOL aircraft are rarely utilized due to the added complexity and design challenges involved. As an
            exercise in learning and fun I have designed, built, and flown small VTOL UAVs.

        <h2>VTOL Version 1</h2>

            <img src="images/vtol1.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-left:15%; padding:2%;">
        <p>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            During my gap year over 2017-2018, I created my first VTOL aircraft (shown above). 
            I chose the odd design due to its mechanical and electrical simplicity. The need to control every degree
            of freedom in both forward flight and hover often leads to highly complex systems with numerous actuators. 
            After researching previous designs, I settled on the a two-motor, elevon vectoring, tail-sitter 
            design. This simple approach maintains control with only 2 brushless thrust motors and 2 servo motors. 
            It used a Pixhawk 2.1 flight control board and a Here GPS unit running ArduPilot's arduplane firmware. 
            <br><br>
            In hover, pitch and yaw are controlled vectoring the motor thrust by the use of the two oversized
            elevons. When the elevons pitch down, the motor's thrust creates a moment by which the nose pitches 
            forward. In the same way, opposite action of the elevons in a hover creates a torque which then rotates
            the aircraft in yaw. Thrust motor differential thust controls roll. 
            <br><br>
            In forward flight, the aircraft performs much like a standard flying wing, where motor control changes 
            the total amount of energy carried, and elevons maintian directional control. 
            <br><br>
            <h3>Flight Testing </h3>
            To test the effectiveness of the design, the aircraft was put through a set of flight tests 
            after preliminary PID gain tuning.
            <h4>Hover Testing</h4>
            This design was more stable in a hover than I expected given the control system. Hover tests
            showed that the aircraft quickly returned to GPS position when nuged or pulled away from the set loiter
            point. Take off was challenging due to an interaction between the wide landing gear and control 
            system. This a sharp burst of power on take off was used for all future flights in order to provide 
            sufficent airflow over the elevons to maintian control off the ground. Another challenge due to the design
            was descent. When descending, airflow partially reversed across the elevons causing loss of control during
            fast descents. Hover descents were performed slowly in the following flight tests.
            <h4>Transition and Forward Flight Tests</h4>
            The most challenging and risky part of flight testing a VTOL design is the first transition to forward
            flight. Before a flight test was performed, a flight was simulated on the ground with thrust motor 
            propellers removed in order to verify correct directional correction and transition settings. Once the 
            control system was verified, the first transition flight test began. At an altitude sufficent to allow for 
            an abort to hover, the flight controller was set to forward flight and the aircraft accelerated as it rotated
            level. Forward flight proved to be somewhat difficult to control becuase of the oversized elevons, yet was still
            highly sucessfull. I made many tuning flights attempting to improve controllibility, and although I made progress,
            I still felt a design change was needed to fully meet my goals. 
        </p>

        <h2>VTOL Version 2</h2>

        <img src="images/vtol_rear.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-left:15%; padding:2%;">
    <p>
        During the summer of 2019, I completed my second VTOL aircraft. This design was much more advanced and 
        and complex than my original prototype as a conventional, triple tilt-motor design. I traded the simplicity 
        of the original design for an increase in efficency, usability, and controlability. Flight control was provided 
        by the same flight controller and firmware, with a different setup and tuning. 
        <br><br>
        In hover, pitch and roll are controlled by differential motor thrust, much like a standard multirotor. 
        Yaw is controled by using the front two motor tilt mechanisms in opposition to create a torque. This is similar
        to a tri-copter design. Aerodynamic control surfaces are not used for hover control.   
        <br><br>
        In forward flight, the aircraft performs much like a conventional aircraft, where where motor control changes 
        the total amount of energy carried, and standard aerodynamic control surfaces maintian directional control.
